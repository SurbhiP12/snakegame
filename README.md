# Snake Game in Python

This project is about creating the classic Snake game using Python. The game is simple: the player controls a snake that needs to eat apples. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer. The game ends when the snake hits the screen border or its own body.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

First, you need to install Python and Pygame. You can download Python from the official website. After installing Python, you can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Game Logic

The game logic is as follows:

1. Initialize the game window using Pygame.
2. Display the snake and the apple on the screen.
3. Move the snake in the direction specified by the player's input.
4. Check if the snake has eaten the apple.
5. If the snake has eaten the apple, increase the length of the snake and randomly reposition the apple.
6. If the snake hits the screen border or its own body, end the game.
7. Update the screen with the new positions of the snake and the apple.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 until the game ends.

## Running the Game

To run the game, navigate to the directory containing the Python script and run the following command:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to create a simple game using Python and Pygame. It's a fun and interesting way to improve your Python skills. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
